# CFC Project - Vulner
## Introduction
Vulnerability assessment is a systematic review of a system. It evaluates if the system has any kind of vulnerability or if those vulnerabilities are caused by misconfigured services, and recommends remediation or mitigation, if and whenever needed.

Vulnerability assessment is a time-consuming process. This project aims to automate some of the processes in vulnerability assessment. Processes like using Nmap to discover hosts in the network, discover if any users have weak passwords implemented, run vulnerability scans, etc.
